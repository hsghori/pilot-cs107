    "Creating our own Objects can be very useful - but what if we want to create related Objects? For example, what if we've written a Cake object and now we want to create a BrithdayCake object. The BirthdayCake should be very similar to the Cake but with slight alterations. Java allows us to take advantage of these relationships by \"extending\" classes. If ClassB \"extends\" or \"inherits from\" ClassA, ClassB is said to be a child class of ClassA. ClassB has all of the member variables and methods of ClassA and ClassB can define additional member variables and methods."
