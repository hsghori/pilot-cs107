# Introductory Programming in Java Notes

This repo contains notes and examples I wrote for students enrolled in the [PILOT program](http://advising.jhu.edu/tutoring-mentoring/peer-led-team-learning-pilot/) for CS 107 (Introductory Programming in Java) at JHU. The notes should align with most intro programming courses.

The jupyter notebooks in this repo use the IJava Kernel based on Java 9. If you want to download the notes and mess with them on your own, see the installation and usage instructions
